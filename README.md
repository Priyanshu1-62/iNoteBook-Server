### 🧭 Backend architecture overview
 - This is a Express based server for iNoteBook web application and handles API requests for authentication, authorization, and notes manipulation.
 - All route handlers and Mongoose schemas are seperated w.r.t their role and modular design is strictly followed while file structuring.
 - Auth endpoint includes these routes handlers: Signup, Login, GetUser, Refreshing sessions, Logout and RememberMe. Notes endpoint includes these routes handlers: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
 -  Many security practices have been incoorporated in order to sanitize user input, validate input while masking any extra info from brute-force attackers, provide necessaary alert and error messeges, and authorize user with robust JSON web token system.
 - The server communicates with database (MongoDB Atlas) using Mongoose, an Object Data Modelling library.
